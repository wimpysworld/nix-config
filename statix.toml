# W07 (eta_reduction) is disabled because statix incorrectly eta-reduces
# multi-argument lambdas passed to lib.filterAttrs. For example, it reduces:
#   (_name: entry: predicate entry) -> (_name: predicate)
# which changes the arity and returns a function instead of a boolean.
# See lib/flake-builders.nix line 342 (generateConfigs).
