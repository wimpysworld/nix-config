# Third-party licenses

The diagram-design skill itself is MIT-licensed (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)). It bundles content from the following third-party sources, redistributed under their respective licenses.

## Tabler Icons

## log-z/logos

- **License:** MIT
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/log-z/logos/tree/main/website-logos
- **Used in:** filled brand silhouettes that aren't carried by Simple Icons or Tabler — currently MySQL, Redis, and StarRocks. Source SVGs are 100×100 with embedded `<style>` + class-based fills; the build script strips the style block and rewrites class refs to `currentColor` for monochrome consistency.

The MIT license is reproduced in full at https://github.com/log-z/logos/blob/main/LICENSE.

## Devicon

- **License:** MIT
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/devicons/devicon
- **Used in:** the RStudio and SPSS icons in `scripts/vendor/icons/devicon/`.

The MIT license is reproduced in full at https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/LICENSE.

## One-off sourced icons

The `scripts/vendor/icons/url/` directory contains one-off sourced icons for SAS, from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SAS_logo_horiz.svg) (public domain), and Stata, from the [IcePanel Technology Icons collection](https://icon.icepanel.io/Technology/svg/Stata.svg) published via techicons.dev. Their provenance is recorded here; use of these product marks is covered by the Trademarks note below.
