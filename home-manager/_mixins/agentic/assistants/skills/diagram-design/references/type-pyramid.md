# Pyramid / Funnel

**Best for:** hierarchy of needs, prioritization ranks, value pyramids, conversion funnels, content importance stacks.

## Two orientations — pick one
- **Pyramid** (point up) — narrow apex = most important / rarest / most valuable. Base is broadest / foundational.
- **Funnel** (point down) — narrow end = conversion (smallest group). Top is widest / audience.

Don't mix orientations on one diagram.

## Layout conventions
- 4–6 layers. Each layer is a trapezoid built from an SVG `<polygon>` with 4 points.
- Consistent layer height (56–72px).
- Widths decrease linearly from base to apex (pyramid) or top to bottom (funnel). When showing real funnel data, widths must be honest (proportional to count/percentage).
- Each layer has:
  - **Name label** centered inside the trapezoid — Geist 12–14px 600.
  - **Sublabel** below or beside the name — Geist Mono 9–10px.
  - **Side annotation** (right or left) — optional. For funnels: drop-off percentage here (`−40%`).
- Fill: subtle graded tints OR all paper-2 with hairline dividers (cleaner). Pick one.
- Stroke: 1px hairline between layers; outer silhouette 1px muted or ink.
- **Coral on ONE layer only**: apex of pyramid, conversion layer of funnel, or critical bottleneck.
- Optional left-margin axis arrow + Geist Mono label (`rarer ↑`, `drop-off ↓`).

## Anti-patterns
- 7+ layers (illegible — compress or split).
- Pyramid for non-hierarchical data (use a tree or bar chart).
- Dishonest widths (fake equal spacing when drops are unequal).
- Coral on the base layer (dilutes the "apex = rare" signal).
