# Draw.io import output spec — format × size × detail × audience

Four dials decide what an imported diagram becomes. Set them **before** redrawing — they change the deliverable, layout, type ramp, node count, and wording, so retrofitting them afterwards means redrawing.

| Dial | Question it answers | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Format** | Where does this file land? | `html` |
| **Size** | How big is the canvas, and how far away is the reader? | `doc-inline` |
| **Detail level** | Reproduce every element, or compress it? | `balanced` |
| **Audience** | How technical should the wording be? | `mixed` |

Infer choices that are clear from the request (for example, "for my deck" implies a slide preset). Ask one concise question for anything material that remains ambiguous. If the user does not care, use the defaults above and say which ones you used.

## 1. Format

| Format | Deliverable | Keeps | Drops |
|---|---|---|---|
| `html` | self-contained `.html` (default) | header, diagram, summary cards, footer, live fonts | nothing |
| `svg` | `.svg` next to the source | the `<svg>` node, vector text | editorial wrapper; fonts substitute in offline tools |
| `png` | `.png` at `device_scale_factor` | pixels exactly as the browser renders them | vector editability |
| `html+png` | both | — | — |

Always generate the HTML first — `svg` and `png` are produced *from* it via [`export.md`](export.md). Never hand-author an SVG file directly; the HTML is the source of truth and the only artifact the taste gate (SKILL.md §9) is written against.

Pick by destination:

| Destination | Format | Size preset |
|---|---|---|
| Blog post, README, docs site | `html` (embed) or `png` | `doc-inline` |
| Keynote / PowerPoint / Google Slides | `png` @2 | `slide-16x9` |
| Figma / Illustrator / further editing | `svg` | `fit` |
| X / LinkedIn / OG link card | `png` @2 | `social-og` |
| Printed handout, PDF deck | `png` @3 | `print-a4-landscape` |
| Confluence / Notion / internal wiki | `png` @2 | `doc-wide` |

## 2. Size

The preset sets the SVG `viewBox`. Every value below is divisible by 4, so the grid rule in SKILL.md §7 still holds.

| Preset | viewBox | Aspect | PNG @2 | Type ramp | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `doc-inline` (default) | `0 0 960 600` | 8:5 | 1920×1200 | standard | Body-width diagram in a post or README |
| `doc-wide` | `0 0 1280 720` | 16:9 | 2560×1440 | standard | Full-width docs, wiki pages |
| `slide-16x9` | `0 0 1280 720` | 16:9 | 2560×1440 | presentation | Deck slide, projected |
| `slide-4x3` | `0 0 1024 768` | 4:3 | 2048×1536 | presentation | Legacy deck templates |
| `social-og` | `0 0 1200 632` | ~1.9:1 | 2400×1264 | presentation | Link preview card |
| `social-square` | `0 0 1080 1080` | 1:1 | 2160×2160 | presentation | Feed post, carousel |
| `print-a4-landscape` | `0 0 1120 792` | ~1.41:1 | @3 → 3360×2376 | print | A4 landscape, ~10mm margins at 96dpi |
| `print-letter-landscape` | `0 0 1056 816` | ~1.29:1 | @3 → 3168×2448 | print | US Letter landscape |
| `fit` | derived from content | any | @2 | standard | Vector hand-off; no fixed frame |

### Deriving `fit`

Round the content bounding box **up** to the next multiple of 4, then add the fixed chrome: 40px outer margin on every side, plus 60px at the bottom for the legend strip. Never let the content touch the viewBox edge.

### Type ramp per size class

Node names shrink relative to the canvas as it grows — resist that. Scale the ramp with the preset so a projected slide stays readable from the back row.

| Role | standard | presentation | print |
|---|---|---|---|
| Title (Instrument Serif) | 28 | 40 | 32 |
| Node name (Geist 600) | 12 | 16 | 12 |
| Sublabel (Geist Mono) | 9 | 12 | 9 |
| Arrow label (Geist Mono) | 8 | 12 | 8 |
| Eyebrow / tag (Geist Mono) | 8 | 8 | 8 |
| Node box min height | 48 | 64 | 48 |
| Min gap between nodes | 24 | 40 | 24 |

Presentation ramp implies fewer nodes — 16px names in 64px boxes eat the canvas. If a `slide-16x9` layout won't fit, that's the size dial telling you the detail dial is set too high; drop a level rather than shrinking the type.

### Safe areas

- **All presets:** 40px outer margin; legend strip is the bottom 60px and nothing else lives there.
- **`social-og`:** keep the outer 64px clear on every side — link-card crops are unpredictable across platforms.
- **`slide-*`:** keep the bottom 80px clear if the deck template has a footer bar; ask if unsure.

## 3. Detail level

How much of the source survives. This is a *count* dial — it governs how many elements make it through, not how they're worded (that's §4).

| Level | Nodes | Edges | Sublabels | What survives |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `faithful` (詳細) | ≤24, zoned | ≤32 | every port, protocol, version | Every distinct component in the source. Only exact duplicates merge. |
| `balanced` (default) | ≤12 | ≤16 | technical sublabel on ≤4 nodes | Components that carry the story; leaf clusters collapse to one node each. |
| `simplified` (簡略) | ≤7 | ≤9 | none | Capabilities and their sequence. Infrastructure disappears. |

`balanced` and `simplified` sit inside the standard complexity budget (SKILL.md §7). **`faithful` deliberately exceeds it** — that's the trade, and it comes with conditions:

1. **Zoning is mandatory.** Above 9 nodes, every node belongs to a labeled zone (2–4 zones, hairline-bordered, `paper-2` fill, mono uppercase zone label at top-left). An unzoned 20-node diagram is a wiring diagram, not a schematic.
2. **Connector rules don't relax.** SKILL.md §6 rules 1–5 still apply at 24 nodes. If you can't route it without overlaps, you're over the real ceiling — split.
3. **Above 24 nodes, split.** Produce an overview (zones as nodes, `balanced` grammar) plus one detail diagram per zone. Name them `<base>-overview.html`, `<base>-<zone>.html`. Never ship a 40-node single canvas.
4. **Accent stays at 2.** More nodes never buys more focal elements.

### Degrade ladder

When the source has more than the level allows, cut in this order and stop as soon as you're under budget. Never cut ad hoc.

1. **Decorative cells** — sticky notes, free-floating text, title blocks, watermarks, the source's own legend. (Notes worth keeping become annotation callouts — max 2, see [primitive-annotation.md](primitive-annotation.md).)
2. **Exact duplicates** — N identical workers/replicas/shards become one node labeled `Worker ×N`.
3. **Leaf clusters** — a container whose children are all leaves collapses to the container: `Core Services` replaces its three boxes. The extractor lists these under *collapsible groups*.
4. **Degree-1 sinks that don't change the story** — a monitoring hook, a log bucket, an archive tier.
5. **Cross-cutting infrastructure** — logging, metrics, secrets, CI. At `simplified` these go without asking; at `balanced` keep at most one, and only if the diagram is about it.
6. **Still over?** Split into overview + detail. Splitting beats shrinking.

Anything cut in steps 2–6 goes in the fidelity ledger (§5). Step 1 doesn't need reporting.

## 4. Audience level

Independent of the detail dial: the same 12 nodes get named differently for a platform team than for a steering committee. Detail sets *how many*; audience sets *what they're called*.

| Audience | Node names | Sublabels | Edge labels | Never |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `engineer` | exact service / component names | protocol, port, version, image tag | `POST /v2/orders`, `SQL`, `gRPC` | Vague verbs like "connects to" |
| `mixed` (default) | component names, expanded acronyms | technology only where it changes a decision | plain verbs — `verifies`, `writes`, `notifies` | Ports, versions, internal codenames |
| `executive` | capabilities and outcomes | none | business verbs — `approves`, `pays out` | Vendor names, infrastructure, protocols |

Worked example — the same node through all three:

| Audience | Node name | Sublabel |
|---|---|---|
| `engineer` | `Auth Service` | `JWT · RS256 · :8443` |
| `mixed` | `Auth Service` | `token check` |
| `executive` | `Sign-in` | — |

Two rules that hold at every audience level:

- **Never invent detail to fill a slot.** If the source says `svc-04`, `executive` output says what it does only if you can tell from context — otherwise ask, don't guess a business name.
- **Keep the source's vocabulary for proper nouns.** Renaming `Kafka` to `Message Bus` is fine at `executive`; renaming it to `Event Grid` (a different product) is a factual error.

### Non-Latin labels

Geist has no CJK coverage. When labels contain Japanese, Chinese, or Korean text, extend the family on those `<text>` elements — don't swap the whole skin:

```svg
<text font-family="'Geist', 'Hiragino Sans', 'Noto Sans JP', 'Yu Gothic', sans-serif">認証サービス</text>
<text font-family="'Geist', 'Noto Sans KR', 'Apple SD Gothic Neo', 'Malgun Gothic', sans-serif">인증 서비스</text>
<text font-family="'Geist', 'PingFang SC', 'Noto Sans SC', 'Microsoft YaHei', sans-serif">认证服务</text>
<text font-family="'Geist', 'Noto Sans TC', 'PingFang TC', 'Microsoft JhengHei', sans-serif">認證服務</text>
```

The Hiragino/Yu Gothic stack carries no Hangul glyphs, so Korean labels need the Korean stack — don't reuse the Japanese one. Noto Sans KR ships in the skin's font link, so it leads that stack and the local families follow it; the register, floor, and title rules Korean needs beyond the font live in [`style-guide.md`](style-guide.md#korean-labels). Japanese fonts also cover only a subset of the Chinese character set and render Simplified forms with Japanese glyph variants, so Chinese labels need a Chinese stack; Simplified and Traditional are separate stacks for the same reason. Noto Sans TC now ships in the link too, so it leads the Traditional stack and the local families follow; the register, floor, and title rules Traditional Chinese needs beyond the font live in [`style-guide.md`](style-guide.md#traditional-chinese-labels). For mono sublabels use `'Geist Mono', 'Noto Sans Mono CJK JP', monospace` (Japanese), `'Geist Mono', 'Noto Sans Mono CJK KR', monospace` (Korean), or `'Geist Mono', 'Noto Sans Mono CJK SC', monospace` / `'Geist Mono', 'Noto Sans Mono CJK TC', monospace` (Chinese). Budget **1em per full-width CJK glyph**, not a small percentage over the average Latin glyph; `verify-treemap.py` uses that conservative contract for Unicode wide/full-width characters and treats combining marks as non-advancing. Prefer 12px names over 8px sublabels for CJK; Hangul and Han go muddy below 12px, so treat 12px as the floor rather than 10px. Actual width still varies by fallback font, so run the relevant geometry verifier after translating labels.

## 5. Fidelity ledger

Any time output is smaller than input — every `balanced` and `simplified` run, and most `faithful` ones — report what you cut, in chat, after the file path. Short and specific:

```
Detail: balanced · 18 source nodes → 9 drawn
Merged:  worker-01..06 → "Ingest Worker ×6"
Collapsed: "Observability" group (Grafana, Loki, Tempo) → one node
Dropped: 2 sticky notes, CI pipeline (cross-cutting)
Kept in full: the request path (Client → Gateway → Orders → Postgres)
```

The reader of the diagram can't see what's missing. The person who asked for it needs to.
