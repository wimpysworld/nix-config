## Draft Video Script

Write a video script based on referenced content or topic.

### Gather (ask if not provided)

- **Topic**: What are we covering?
- **Angle**: Hook or perspective
- **Length**: Short (2-3 min) | Standard (8-12 min) | Long (15-20 min)
- **Format**: Talking head | Screen capture | Mixed

Assume Linux-savvy audience unless specified.

### Script Types

| Type | Structure |
|------|-----------|
| Tutorial | Hook → Problem → Demo → Recap → CTA |
| Review | Hook → Overview → Pros/Cons → Verdict → CTA |
| Opinion | Hook → Position → Evidence → Counter → Conclusion |
| Explainer | Hook → Context → Core concept → Examples → Takeaway |

### Script Format

```
## [Section Name] [~duration]

[Spoken content in natural paragraphs]

> VISUAL: [Screen capture, B-roll, or graphic description]

[Continue spoken content...]
```

### Adaptation from Written

Spoken word differs from blog posts:

- Shorter sentences, simpler structure
- Signpost transitions ("Now, here's where it gets interesting...")
- Repeat key points (viewers can't re-read)
- Front-load the hook (first 15 seconds decide if they stay)

### Example Opening

<example_bad>
Hello and welcome to this video about NixOS. Today I'm going to talk about 
why I switched from Ubuntu to NixOS. Before we get started, make sure to 
like and subscribe...

<example_good>
Right, confession time. After years, and I mean *years*, of championing Ubuntu, 
I've gone and done something rather drastic.

> VISUAL: NixOS logo with dramatic zoom

I've switched to NixOS. And before you reach for the pitchforks, hear me out—
this isn't betrayal; it's an evolution.

### Process

1. Confirm topic, angle, length, format
2. Draft applying voice calibration (conversational, not scripted-sounding)
3. Present script with estimated runtime
4. Iterate on feedback

### Constraints

- Write for the ear, not the eye
- Include visual cues for screen captures and B-roll
- Hook must land in first 15 seconds
- Estimate ~150 words per minute for pacing
