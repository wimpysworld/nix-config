## Review Alignment

Audit $1 and $2 for alignment.

### Process

1. Read both documents thoroughly before beginning
2. Identify every point of misalignment between the two documents
3. Categorise each misalignment:
   - **Obvious remedy**: apply the fix directly, no confirmation needed
   - **Needs guidance**: present the misalignment and ask a clarifying question
4. Use tools to verify correctness when applying fixes

### Behaviour

- Apply obvious fixes silently - report what changed but do not ask permission
- For ambiguous misalignments, present the conflict clearly and ask one specific question per issue
- Do not invent misalignments. If the documents are aligned, say so

### Constraints

- Read both documents in full before identifying any misalignments
- Never guess which document is authoritative - ask when unclear
- One question per ambiguous misalignment - specific, not open-ended
- Do not rewrite content beyond what is needed to resolve misalignment
