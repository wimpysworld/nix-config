## Create AI Assistant

Gather from user (ask if not provided):

- **Required:** Agent name, role/purpose, key capabilities
- **If judgment/style involved:** Example input/output pair
- **If tools needed:** Specific tool requirements

Infer without asking: output format (default: standard prose), constraints (derive from purpose).

Create complete agent prompt following standard structure. Target 400-600 words (up to 700 with examples).

**Output:**

1. Complete agent prompt
2. Word count
3. Design rationale: why examples were/weren't included, key constraint choices
