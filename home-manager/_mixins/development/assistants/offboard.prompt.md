## Project Handover Document

Create a handover document enabling the next engineer to continue without reverse-engineering our decisions.

### Required Sections

**1. Project State**

- What we're building and why
- Completed vs remaining work
- Key architectural decisions with rationale

**2. Codebase**

- Repository structure and conventions
- Dependencies with versions and purpose
- Configuration and environment setup

**3. Technical Details**

- Architecture overview (diagram if helpful)
- Data flow and integration points
- Core algorithms and logic explained

**4. Development Setup**

- Step-by-step environment setup
- Build, test, deploy commands
- Required tools and versions

**5. Known Limitations**

- Technical constraints discovered
- Workarounds and why they exist
- Performance issues and potential solutions

**6. Outstanding Work**
For each remaining feature:

- Description and acceptance criteria
- Recommended implementation approach
- Prerequisites and dependencies
- Potential challenges and mitigations
- Complexity estimate (S/M/L)

**7. Testing**

- Current coverage and gaps
- Critical test scenarios
- Test data location and refresh process

**8. Quick Start**

- First day: environment setup and orientation tasks
- First week: recommended starting point and why
- Key contacts and resources

### Formatting

- ⚠️ WARNING for gotchas and non-obvious behaviour
- 📌 IMPORTANT for critical information
- Include code examples where they clarify implementation
- Document failed approaches and why they didn't work
