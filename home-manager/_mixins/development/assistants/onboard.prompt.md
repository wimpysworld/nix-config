## Project Onboarding

Review the attached handover document for this project.

**Provide:**

1. Brief summary of your understanding
2. Questions about:
   - Ambiguous technical decisions
   - Missing context or rationale
   - Unclear implementation steps
   - Unfamiliar dependencies or tools
   - Priority or sequencing concerns
3. Concerns about proposed approaches
4. Recommended first feature and why

Clarify now rather than discovering gaps mid-implementation.
