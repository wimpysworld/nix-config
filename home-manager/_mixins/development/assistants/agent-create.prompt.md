## New Agent Creation

Create a new agent prompt. Ask the user to provide the following details:

- Agent name
- Role/purpose
- Key capabilities
- Tool requirements (default: none)
- Output format needs (default: standard prose)
- Target word count (default: 400-600 words)

Follow the standard agent structure. Focus on constraints and output format-these steer behaviour.

Provide the complete agent prompt followed by the word count and brief rationale for key design decisions.
