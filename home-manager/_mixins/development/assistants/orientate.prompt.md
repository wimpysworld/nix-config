## Project Orientation

Orient yourself with the codebase before we begin.

### 1. Review Documentation

In order: README → CONTRIBUTING → ARCHITECTURE → PRD/GDD → CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md → .github/copilot-instructions.md → .cursorrules

### 2. Analyse Codebase

- Directory structure and module organisation
- Entry points and core logic
- Dependencies and configuration
- Test structure and recent commits

### 3. Recall Context

From previous sessions:

- Decisions made and rationale
- Known issues and limitations
- Work in progress
- Project-specific preferences or instructions

### 4. Report

Provide:

- **Summary**: What we're building, current state
- **Context**: Key technologies, conventions, constraints
- **Memory**: Relevant recalled information affecting today's work
- **Gaps**: Missing files, ambiguities, or conflicts between memory and docs
- **Ready**: Confirm orientation complete

Flag any expected files that are missing or inaccessible.
