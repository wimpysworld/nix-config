## Agent Prompt Optimisation

Review and optimise the referenced agent prompt for context efficiency while preserving its core purpose and clarity of purpose.

Preserve all core functionality, and target word count of 400-600 words, up to 700 if complex output formats.

Remove ineffective patterns (checklists, self-review instructions, verbose temporal breakdowns, redundant sections). Preserve output format templates and constraints-these are high-value.

Provide:

1. The optimised agent prompt
2. Changelog table (removed/preserved with rationale)
3. Final word count
