## Implementation Plan

Create an implementation plan for inclusion in the project, optimised for AI-assisted development.

**Per Task:**

- **ID**: TASK-001: Descriptive name
- **Dependencies**: What must be complete first
- **Scope**: Files/functions to modify
- **Success Criteria**: How to verify it works
- **Complexity**: S/M/L/XL
- **Review Points**: What needs human review

**Structure:**

- Atomic tasks: completable in one session, independently testable, safely revertible
- Group into chunks of 3-5 related tasks
- Each chunk produces working, testable code
- Clear commit points to save progress

**Flag:**

- High-risk tasks needing extra scrutiny
- Tasks requiring human decisions
- Areas where context window may be challenged

Each step should be self-contained-assume a fresh AI instance per conversation.
