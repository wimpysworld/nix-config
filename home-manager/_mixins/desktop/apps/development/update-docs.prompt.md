## Documentation Update

Update documentation in ${input:codebase:#codebase} to reflect recent changes.

**Cover:**
- What changed and why (features, APIs, interfaces)
- Usage examples for new functionality
- Configuration or setup changes
- Breaking changes and migration steps (if any)
- Known limitations or TODOs

**Update:**
- README if user-facing behaviour changed
- Inline comments where logic changed significantly
- Development guide if setup steps changed

Concise but complete—future developers should understand what changed and how to work with it.
