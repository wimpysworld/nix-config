## Project Orientation & Context Loading

I need you to orient yourself with ${input:variableName:#codebase} before we begin work. Please follow these steps systematically to ensure you have full context:

### 1. **Establish Temporal Context**
- Note the current date and time
- Identify how this relates to any project deadlines or milestones
- Check if any time-sensitive issues need immediate attention

### 2. **Review Project Documentation**
Read and digest these documents in order:
- **Core Documentation**: README, CONTRIBUTING, ARCHITECTURE docs
- **Product Specs**: PRDs (Product Requirement Documents) or GDDs (Game Design Documents)
- **Project Plans**: Roadmaps, milestones, implementation plans
- **AI Instructions**:
  - CLAUDE.md (Claude-specific instructions)
  - AGENTS.md (AI agent collaboration guidelines)
  - copilot-instructions.md (Copilot integration notes)
  - Any .cursorrules or similar AI instruction files
- **Development Guides**: Setup instructions, coding standards, testing strategies

### 3. **Analyse Codebase**
Systematically review the source code:
- **Structure**: Directory layout and module organisation
- **Entry Points**: Main files, APIs, or executable scripts
- **Core Logic**: Key algorithms and business logic
- **Dependencies**: Package files, external libraries used
- **Configuration**: Environment files, config schemas
- **Tests**: Test structure and coverage patterns
- **Recent Changes**: Latest commits or pull requests if available

### 4. **Retrieve Memory Context**
Use your memory graph to recall:
- Previous sessions on this project
- Decisions made and their rationale
- Known issues or limitations discovered
- Work in progress or planned features
- Personal preferences or specific instructions from me
- Any "gotchas" or non-obvious behaviours noted

### 5. **Synthesis & Readiness Check**
After completing the above, provide:
- **Project Summary**: Brief overview of what we're building and current state
- **Context Confirmation**: Key technologies, conventions, and constraints understood
- **Memory Highlights**: Relevant recalled information that affects today's work
- **Questions**: Any ambiguities or missing information needed
- **Readiness Statement**: Confirm you're oriented and ready to proceed

**Note**: If any expected files are missing or inaccessible, list them so I can provide them. If memory recall brings up conflicting information with current documentation, flag it for clarification.

Ready to begin once you've completed this orientation process.
