## Documentation Plan

Review documentation and information architecture in ${input:codebase:#codebase}.

**Produce:**
1. Current state assessment (what exists, what's missing, what's stale)
2. Prioritised improvement plan with rationale
3. Proposed structure/reorganisation if needed

Focus on gaps that actually hurt users. Skip improvements that are nice-to-have.
