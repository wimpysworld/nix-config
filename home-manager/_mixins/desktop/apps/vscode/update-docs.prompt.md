You've just completed implementing new features and fixes in ${input:variableName:#codebase}. Please update the project documentation to reflect these changes.

**Update the following:**

- Modified files and their new purpose
- New functions/methods with their signatures
- Changed interfaces or APIs
- Updated dependencies or versions

### 2. **Feature Documentation**
- What was implemented and how it works
- Usage examples or code snippets
- Configuration changes required
- Any new command-line options or parameters

### 3. **Technical Decisions**
- Why specific approaches were chosen
- Trade-offs considered and final choice rationale
- Any deviations from the original plan and why

### 4. **Testing & Validation**
- New test cases added
- How to verify the feature works
- Edge cases handled or still pending

### 5. **Migration Notes** (if applicable)
- Breaking changes
- Steps to update existing code/config
- Backwards compatibility considerations

### 6. **Known Issues & TODOs**
- Limitations discovered during implementation
- Planned improvements
- Workarounds for any issues

**Format Requirements:**
- Update inline code comments where logic changed significantly
- Update README if user-facing functionality changed
- Add any new setup steps to the development guide
- Include code examples for complex features

Keep documentation concise but complete - future developers (human or AI) should understand what changed and how to work with it.
