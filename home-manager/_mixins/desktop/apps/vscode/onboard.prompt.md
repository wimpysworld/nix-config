## Project Onboarding & Handover Review

I'm bringing you onto an existing project. The previous AI engineer has prepared a comprehensive handover document that contains:

- Project overview and current state
- Codebase structure and conventions
- Technical implementation details
- Known limitations and constraints
- Outstanding features with implementation plans
- Testing strategy and documentation

**Your task:**

1. **Thoroughly review** the entire handover document
2. **Identify any gaps** in your understanding
3. **Ask clarifying questions** about:
   - Ambiguous technical decisions or architecture
   - Missing context or rationale
   - Unclear implementation steps
   - Dependencies or tools you're unfamiliar with
   - Constraints that might affect proposed solutions
   - Priority or sequencing of outstanding features

**Before we begin implementation:**

Please provide:
- A brief summary of your understanding of the project
- A list of specific questions or clarifications you need
- Any concerns about the proposed implementation approach
- Confirmation of which feature you recommend tackling first and why

Don't hesitate to ask about anything unclear - it's better to clarify now than discover issues mid-implementation. I'm here to fill in any gaps the handover document might have missed.

Once we've addressed your questions, we'll proceed with implementation.
