## Contents

This folder contains the source for the (current) Material Design Icons.
Source is https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-Font

Last fetch date is Oct 6, 2022.

After fetching a new file one needs to correct our cheat-sheet by updating `bin/scripts/lib/i_md.sh`.
Use the tool:
```
cd bin/scripts
mv lib/i_md.sh lib/i_md.sh_
python3 generate-glyph-info-from-set.py --start f0001 -end f1af0 -font ../../src/glyphs/materialdesign/MaterialDesignIconsDesktop.ttf -offset 0 -prefix md > lib/i_md.sh
```

Open old and new definitions shell script and copy the header from the old file to the autogenerated file. Adapt the values in the new file's header. Remove the last line in the new file (it contains the number of glyphs that is needed for the updated header). Yes, that is some manual labor.


## Source bugs fixed

Glyph 0xF1522 is broken in the original font. We fixed that one glyph manually.
