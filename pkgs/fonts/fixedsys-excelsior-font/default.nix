      Fixedsys Excelsior is a modified version of the Fixedsys font; a family of
      raster monospaced fonts. The font was originally authored by Darien
      Valentine and provided via a now-defunct site at fixedsysexcelsior.com.
      This derivative adds programming ligatures and fixes rendering and hinting.

      This version is patched to include Nerd Font and Braille glyphs.
